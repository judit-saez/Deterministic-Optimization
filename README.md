Optimization of Rosenbrock's Function by Conjugate Gradient Descent and Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm

There are two codes named CG and LM. The first one implements the Conjugate Gradient Descent Method and the second the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.
They both aim to find the global minimum of the Rosenbrock Function. 

More details can be found in the report.
